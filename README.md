# Risk-Profiling-Predictive-Analytics-for-Car-Insurance
This project Analyzes historical insurance claims to enhance marketing strategies by identifying low-risk customers. Aims to optimize pricing, attract new clients, and reduce costs using statistical and machine learning techniques.

## Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

 **Data Summarization**
   - **Descriptive Statistics**: Calculate variability for numerical features such as TotalPremium, TotalClaim, etc.
   - **Data Structure**: Review the dtype of each column to confirm if categorical variables, dates, etc. are properly formatted.

 **Data Quality Assessment**
   - Check for missing values and address them as needed.

 **Univariate Analysis**
   - **Distribution of Variables**: Plot histograms for numerical columns and bar charts for categorical columns to understand their distributions.

 **Bivariate or Multivariate Analysis**
   - **Correlations and Associations**: Explore relationships between variables, such as the monthly changes in TotalPremium and TotalClaims as a function of ZipCode. Use scatter plots and correlation matrices to visualize these relationships.

 **Data Comparison**
   - **Trends Over Geography**: Compare changes in insurance cover type, premium, auto make, and other relevant factors across different geographical regions.

 **Outlier Detection**
   - Use box plots to identify outliers in numerical data.

 **Visualization**
   - Produce three creative and insightful plots that capture the key insights gained from your EDA.
